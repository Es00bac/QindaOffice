## Build gates (every milestone)

```
cmake --preset dev
cmake --build --preset dev
ctest --preset dev --output-on-failure
```

Widget tests run under `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen` (pinned via ctest
`ENVIRONMENT`; each test's `main` also sets it defensively).

## On-desktop manual checklist (run inside a QindaQt session)

From the M0 acceptance criteria:

- [ ] Launch two `qindawrite` windows; Meta+Shift-drag one onto the other —
      they group into a container as **tabs**.
- [ ] Drag one tab to a screen edge — the container becomes a **split**.
- [ ] The panel shows the **global menu** of the focused window; with the
      export announced, the in-window menu bar is hidden and *View ▸ Show
      Menu Bar* brings it back.
- [ ] `Ctrl+W` / `Ctrl+Q` close the current window only; the process exits
      when its last window closes.
- [ ] The launcher lists QindaWrite / QindaCalc / QindaShow / QindaNote
      under the Office category with the suite icons.

## Milestone-specific gates

Added per milestone in the milestone commit (formula tables, xlsx
round-trips, fodp→pptx conversion, provider smoke tests, pen-input checks,
presenter-view-on-second-screen, reduced-motion, packaging).

### M1 additions (automated)

- `tst_single_instance` — two helper processes over a private session bus:
  primary acquires, secondary hands off and exits 0. Skips with an explicit
  message when the environment cannot spawn a bus or denies Qt name
  ownership (some sandboxed/elevated contexts).
- `tst_libre_office_converter` — live txt→pdf conversion against the
  installed soffice; skipped when the conversion pipeline is unavailable.
- `tst_office_application` — canonical-path uniqueness (duplicate open
  activates), pristine-untitled reuse, recents bookkeeping, 32-window bound.
- `tst_recovery_journal` / `tst_restore_inventory` / `tst_recent_files` /
  `tst_atomic_file_store` / `tst_plain_text_document` — store bounds,
  debounce, round trips, optimistic-revision inputs.

### M1 manual checklist (live desktop)

- [ ] Open a file from the file manager: it lands in a new ordinary window
      (or a pristine untitled one); opening the same file twice activates
      the existing window.
- [ ] Edit, close: Save/Discard/Cancel consent appears; Discard clears the
      recovery entry; Save clears it after writing.
- [ ] Kill the app mid-edit; relaunch: a Recover dialog offers the unsaved
      document; Restore brings it back dirty, Discard forgets it.
- [ ] Settings ▸ Restore Previous Documents (off by default); with it on,
      the previous session's paths reopen at launch.
- [ ] Second launch (`qindawrite file`) from a terminal while one instance
      runs: paths hand off over D-Bus; `--new-instance` bypasses.
